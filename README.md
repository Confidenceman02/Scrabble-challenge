### Motivation
As a dedicated scrabble player myself I decided to give the user the ability to score a word by the letter values and an actual Scrabble 15 x 15 grid like the one below.

This is represented visually using the tty toolkit.

### Functionality
In basic mode the user simply inputs a word and it will return its score value based on letter scores.

```cabbage => 14```

In Scrabble grid mode the user inputs a word, a word direction(across, down) and a starting position(A1).
This will allow the word to be scored with any multipliers the word should accrue.
